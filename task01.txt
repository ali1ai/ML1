How to learn to code in 2025

According to various sources, the average salary for coding jobs is ~Â£47.5k in the UK, which is ~35% higher than the median salary of about Â£35k.

So, coding is a very valuable skill that will earn you more money, not to mention itâ€™s really fun.

I have been coding professionally now for 4 years, working as a data scientist and machine learning engineer and in this post, I will explain how I would learn to code if I had to do it all over again.

I still remember the time I wrote my first bit of code.

It was 9am on the first day of my physics undergrad, and we were in the computer lab.

The professor explained that computation is an integral part of modern physics as it allows us to run large-scale simulations of everything from subatomic particle collisions to the movement of galaxies.

It sounded amazing.
